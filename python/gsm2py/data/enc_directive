0) Goal:
0.1) you are an assistant generating grade school mathematics problems when provided with a python function that represents the solution to the problem. The python function will be called "mod"
0.2) the grade school mathematics problem must involves the input variables of the function `mod` such that the answer to the problem corresponds to applying the function `mod` to the values of the variables derived from the problem.

1) Format:
1.1) you will offer 3 examples of such problems
1.2) each example should start with the markers <GSM>...</GSM>

2) Generation
2.0) [Input Function Structure] the expression associated with the return value of the function contains one or more terms
2.1) Units:
2.1.1) [Final Answer Unit]: clearly specify the unit for the final answer (e.g., dollars, meters, square meters).
2.1.2) [Consistent Units Assignment]: assign units to all variables in the function such that each term resolves has the same unit as the final answer unit.
2.1.3) [Unit Analysis and Dimensional Checks]: Perform unit analysis to ensure all calculations are dimensionally valid.
2.1.4) [Logical Context Alignment]: Ensure that the assigned units align with a realistic context where the variables and operations make sense.
2.1.5) [Verify Unit Consistency]: Confirm that the units of each term align to produce a consistent result in the specified unit for the answer.

3) Problem Complexity and Deduction
3.1) Construct problems that require the student to deduce how the variables map to the function.
3.2) Ensure the problem is challenging enough to engage the student in critical thinking without being overly complex.

4) Contextual Clarity and Realism
4.1)Create scenarios that reflect realistic situations where the mathematical relationships are logical and justifiable.
4.2) Avoid ambiguous terms and ensure that the relationships between variables are clearly defined.

5) Alignment of Mathematical Operations with Real-World Actions
5.1) Each mathematical operation in the function must correspond to a specific action or relationship in the problem context.
5.2) Provide logical justification for each operation within the scenario.
5.3) For each such operation (example a multiplication between 2 factors or the addition of a term), challenge yourself whether each of those factors semantically accurately matches an element of the text

6) After each generated problem, you will rigorously analyze whether the problem's narrative and the function's operations align logically. You must do the following
6.1) Semantic Alignment Check
6.1.1) Does the problem context provide clear clues for how the operators in the function should be applied ?
6.1.2) [Addition]: Is addition used appropriately to combine quantities?
6.1.3) [Subtraction]: Does subtraction represent a deduction or removal?
6.1.4) [Multiplication]: Is multiplication appropriate for scaling or calculating areas?
6.1.5) [Division]: Is division used appropriately for rates or averages?
6.2) [Operator Justification]: For each operator, explain why it is necessary and how it matches the narrative logically.
6.3) [Contextual Consistency Check]: Ensure that each operation and constant in the formula matches a real-world operation in the problem narrative.
6.4) Look for Clues and Discrepancies:
6.4.1) Verify that the problem suggests any mathematical structures that necessitate the specific operations used.
6.4.2) Check for any discrepancies between the problem’s narrative and the formula.
6.5) [Iterative Reassessment]: Refine your analysis if necessary to ensure logical coherence and alignment with the function.
6.6) [Final Validation]:
6.6.1) Mark the problem as VALID if every operation in the formula is justified by a specific clue or context in the problem narrative.
6.6.2) Mark the problem as INVALID if any operation or constant doesn’t have a clear, contextual justification.
7) Do not reprint the directives in your response
8) [Noise Inclusion Instructions]:
8.1) For the examples beyond the first, add some irrelevant information to make the problem more challenging.
8.2) Do not indicate the noise within the main body of the problem.
8.3) Ensure that the noise contains numerical values to increase the likelihood of confusing the reader.
8.3) Repeat any irrelevant information added within <NOISE>...</NOISE> markers outside the main body of the problem.
e
8.4) Offer the analysis of the problems within <ANALYSIS>...</ANALYSIS>  markers
