        "solution": "Let her previous monthly income be p\nThe cost of her rent and utilities was 40% of p which is (40/100)*p = 2p/5\nHer income was increased by $600 so it is now p+$600\nThe cost of her rent and utilities now amount to 25% of (p+$600) which is (25/100)*(p+$600) = (p+$600)/4\nEquating both expressions for cost of rent and utilities: 2p/5 = (p+$600)/4\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 20 gives 8p = 5p+$3000\nSubtracting 5p from both sides gives: 3p = $3000\nDividing both sides by 3 gives p = $1000\n#### 1000",
